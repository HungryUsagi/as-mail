This is an Applescript script to automate creation and sending of messages in the native MacOS Mail app. 

This script should be used with Automator to create a functional .app application. 
After application creation, you can place a file to be attached automatically in the root of the .app. 

Right click the .app, show contents, and place your file there (NOT in the contents folder).
